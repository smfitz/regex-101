# Regex Tutorial for Finding/Validating an IP Address

As I approched this topic of "Regular Expressions" I quickly realized I had to step away from thinking of finding a solution though programing with a traditional programing language. Instead I had to look at the subject as an *almost completely different topic with different rule sets of rules that weren't limited to a specfic programing language. Instead it is a tool for developers that you can create using any text editor, to aid in finding specfic strings or forms of data. This was a confusing topic for me to delve into but I hope after reading my "cheat sheet" that you can gain a better understanding of what ReGex is and how it can help with many tasks. 

## Summary

As stated in <a href="https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-science/regex-tutorial" target="_blank">The Full-Stack Blog</a>, "JavaScript has many useful methods that can check if a string contains a certain letter or phrase." Knowing only this going into this tutorial I knew I would be creating some kind of Regular Expression thats main purpose was to find a match based on a input. This is where I started to step away from what I was more comfortable with attempting in JavaScript and instead thought of a useful functionality I could create using Regular Expressions and could possibly use in the future within my own personal projects. Although not yet useful to me in any of my own projects, I took more interest in creating a regex that could find/validate an IP address. This cheat sheet will cover basic concepts of regular expressions with a more tailored approach to my specfic regex. This is what my final result looked like.
